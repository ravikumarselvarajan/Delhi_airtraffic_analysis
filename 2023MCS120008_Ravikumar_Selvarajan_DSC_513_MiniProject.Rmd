## Please note we are not picking up station hour wise data because the weather data we have is only day wise data

## Out of the cities for which weather has been provided, the only city that overlaps with the AQI data is Delhi
## And ofcourse we are trying to find the impact of AQI on Airtraffic in Delhi, so lets bring in that too
## So lets merge these three datasets only for Delhi

Delhi_AQI_data_temp <- New_AQ_station_day %>% filter ((StationId == "DL001") | (StationId == "DL019"))%>% mutate(Date_1 = ymd(as.Date(Date)))
Delhi_AQI_data <- Delhi_AQI_data_temp[, -2] %>% rename("Date" = "Date_1")

New_Weather_Delhi_day <- New_Weather_Delhi %>% mutate(Date = dmy(time))

Delhi_Airport_Delay_date <- New_Airport_delay %>% filter (Departure.Airport == "DEL") %>% mutate(Date_1 = dmy(Date))
Delhi_Airport_Delay_rename <- Delhi_Airport_Delay_date[, -1] %>% rename("Date" = "Date_1")
Delhi_Airport_Delay_date_sorted <- Delhi_Airport_Delay_rename[order(Delhi_Airport_Delay_rename$Date),]

## The range of weather data is from 01/01/1990 to 25/07/2022
## The range of airport delay data is from 28/01/18 to 27/1/2020

## So the overlapping range is from 1/11/2018 to 26/1/2020

Delhi_Airport_Delay_range <- Delhi_Airport_Delay_date_sorted %>% filter (between(Date, as.Date('2018-01-25'), as.Date('2020-01-27')))
#Delhi_Airport_Delay <- Delhi_Airport_Delay_dates %>% filter ((Date >'25-01-18') & (Date < '29-01-20'))  #1925
New_Weather_Delhi_day_range <- New_Weather_Delhi_day %>% filter (between(Date, as.Date('2018-01-25'), as.Date('2020-01-27')))

Delhi_AQI_data_range <- Delhi_AQI_data %>% filter (between(Date, as.Date('2018-01-25'), as.Date('2020-01-27')))

##Delhi_Airport_Delay data has multiple entries for a day as it is cutting across many airliners operating on an airport. But we are interested in average delay per day and not really on the airliner related information. So, lets clean the data a bit there.

convert_min <- function(x)
{
  if(x < 0)
  {
    time_mins = 0
  }
  else
  {
    time_d <- hms(x)
    time_mins <- hour(time_d)*60 + minute(time_d)
  }
}

Delhi_Airport_Delay_in_min <- Delhi_Airport_Delay_range %>% mutate (Departure_Delay_min = unlist(lapply(Departure.Delay, convert_min)), Arrival_Delay_min = unlist(lapply(Arrival.Time.Delay, convert_min)))
Delhi_Airport_Delay_datewise <- Delhi_Airport_Delay_in_min  %>% group_by(Date) %>% summarize(Daily_Delay = sum(Departure_Delay_min + Arrival_Delay_min))

Delhi_Airport_Delay_datewise

Delhi_AQI_weather_data_merge_temp <- merge(New_Weather_Delhi_day, Delhi_AQI_data)
Delhi_AQI_weather_data_merge_temp_1 <- Delhi_AQI_weather_data_merge_temp[,-2]
Delhi_cohesive_dataset <- merge(Delhi_AQI_weather_data_merge_temp_1, Delhi_Airport_Delay_datewise)
Delhi_AQI_weather_data_merge_temp_1
Delhi_cohesive_dataset
#Looks like the merger is successful with no NA
#Lets summarize full dataset
summary(Delhi_cohesive_dataset)
View(Delhi_cohesive_dataset)
```

## Analyse cohesive dataset a bit to understand how delay and other parameters plot each other

```{r}
View(Delhi_cohesive_dataset)
names(Delhi_cohesive_dataset)
ggplot(Delhi_cohesive_dataset, aes(x = AQI, y = Daily_Delay, color = AQI_Bucket, size = prcp)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Impact of AQI and prcp")

##As per the plot, Good AQI too gets observed for some delay cases but they are far and few... and does not seems to have caused high amount of delays 
## There area huge amount of delays caused for satisfactory AQI cases but most of the delays could be associated 
## with pretty high precipitation
## There are good amount of delays associate with moderate cases too and they do have caused significant delays when combined with high precipitations
## Delay instances reduces for Poor AQI cases but there is a slight increase in the values of delays
## For very poor cases, impact gets high when combined with precipitation
## Severe cases are high impact ones but looks like not affected with precipitation


## Now lets view this purely from the weather perspective
View(Delhi_cohesive_dataset)
names(Delhi_cohesive_dataset)
ggplot(Delhi_cohesive_dataset, aes(x = tavg, y = Daily_Delay, color = tmin, size = prcp)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Impact of temp and prcp")

## Its clear that bigger precipitation brings in more instances of delays
## But its also interesting to find that higher tavg, higher precipitation and higher tmin bring 
# in a lot of delays - though size of precipitation does not always result in costly delays

## Ok Lets also analyse if the components O3, PM2.5 and CO has impacts on delays

ggplot(Delhi_cohesive_dataset, aes(x = O3, y = Daily_Delay, size = O3)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Impact of O3")

## Looks like more O3 directly relates to higher delays

ggplot(Delhi_cohesive_dataset, aes(x = PM2.5, y = Daily_Delay, size = PM2.5)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Impact of PM2.5")

## Looks like more PM2.5 might not have too much impact...

ggplot(Delhi_cohesive_dataset, aes(x = CO, y = Daily_Delay, size = CO)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Impact of CO")

## Looks like size of CO has some correlation but may not be linear...

ggplot(Delhi_cohesive_dataset, aes(x = PM10, y = Daily_Delay, size = PM10)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Impact of PM10")

## Looks like more PM2.5 might not have too much impact...

ggplot(Delhi_cohesive_dataset, aes(x = prcp, y = Daily_Delay, size = prcp)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Impact of rain")

## Looks like amount of rain has direct impact on delays...


ggplot(Delhi_cohesive_dataset, aes(x = tavg, y = Daily_Delay, size = tavg)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Impact of Average Temp")

## Looks like a lot of low intensity delays on higher average temprature...

ggplot(Delhi_cohesive_dataset, aes(x = tmin, y = Daily_Delay, size = tmin)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Impact of Tmin")
## Looks like a lot of low intensity delays on higher average temprature...

ggplot(Delhi_cohesive_dataset, aes(x = AQI, y = Daily_Delay, size = AQI, color=AQI_Bucket)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Impact of AQI")

## Looks like a lot of low intensity delays on higher Tmin...

## Ok based on this, lets pick these elements to find the right model on impacts the delays of Delhi airtraffic:
## Precipitation, AQI, tmin, O3 and CO

## Lets see how the elements individually have linear regression relationship with the traffic delay

Delhi_Traffic_Delay_Model_AQI = lm(Daily_Delay ~ AQI, data = Delhi_cohesive_dataset)
fmodel(Delhi_Traffic_Delay_Model_AQI)

Delhi_Traffic_Delay_Model_tavg = lm(Daily_Delay ~ tavg, data = Delhi_cohesive_dataset)
fmodel(Delhi_Traffic_Delay_Model_tavg)

Delhi_Traffic_Delay_Model_prcp = lm(Daily_Delay ~ prcp, data = Delhi_cohesive_dataset)
fmodel(Delhi_Traffic_Delay_Model_prcp)

Delhi_Traffic_Delay_Model_O3 = lm(Daily_Delay ~ O3, data = Delhi_cohesive_dataset)
fmodel(Delhi_Traffic_Delay_Model_O3)

Delhi_Traffic_Delay_Model_CO = lm(Daily_Delay ~ CO, data = Delhi_cohesive_dataset)
fmodel(Delhi_Traffic_Delay_Model_CO)
```

## Model for predicting Delhi air traffic delays

```{r}


Delhi_Traffic_Delay_Model = lm(Daily_Delay ~ prcp+CO+tavg, data = Delhi_cohesive_dataset)
fmodel(Delhi_Traffic_Delay_Model)

```
